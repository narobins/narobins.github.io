				<h3><i>Toymaker</i> Short Film</h3>
				<p>Advanced Animation Production class, Brown 2016.<p>

				<p>Due to the lack of official animation course offerings beyond the introductory sequence at Brown, I proposed a semester-long short film,  <i>Toymaker</i>. The team consists of 7 other CG artists, 2 sound artists, a producer, a composer, and 4 pre-production artists.<p>

				<p>Last spring I developed the concept; over the summer I led pre-production, worked on prop and character designs, and supervised storyboarding; this semester I led character modeling, layout, and lighting teams, and contributed to the shading, animating, and cloth simulation teams.</p>

				<p>Software: Maya, mental ray</p>

					<h4>Pre-production</h4>
					<p>I conceptualized and developed the story in winter/spring 2016. I worked with five other students during summer 2016 on pre-production. Together we
						developed the story and script, designed the characters, environments, and props, and storyboards.
					 I was responsible for prop designs, contributed to the designs of the toymaker,
					 and integrated existing designs into concept art to ensure a cohesive style.</p>
					 <p>The story is about a toymaker who reads picture books to her five-year-old daughter.
						 Since she can't afford to take her daughter to a carnival like the ones in the picture book,
						 she starts building a miniature model for her daughter that gets more and more elaborate and eventually
						 threatens their relationship.</p>
						 <p>Aesthetically, we wanted to convey a certain do-it-yourself attitude of
							 repurposing objects beyond their existing purpose; the designs needed
						 to look like they evolved out of necessity and ingenuity and were repaired
					 to exist past their intended lifespan.</p>
